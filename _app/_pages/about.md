Hi, I’m OrganismZero.

I live in Australia with my family and pets, where I work in IT by day and dive into creative projects by night. My professional world revolves around keeping systems running smoothly, but in my free time, I love building tech solutions that are both fun and practical—like Twitch bots and streamer tools.

Outside of tech, I’m a licensed snake catcher with a deep interest in reptiles, skinks, invertebrates, and wildlife in general. Whether it’s identifying species or brainstorming new ideas, I’m always up for a challenge that blends curiosity and creativity.

If you’ve got an idea or think we could collaborate on something, I’d love to hear from you!
